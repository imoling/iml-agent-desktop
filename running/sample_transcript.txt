Alice: Hi everyone, let's start the meeting. Today we need to discuss the Q1 roadmap for the new Agent Platform.
Bob: Sure. I think we should focus on the "Skills Engine" first. It's the core differentiator.
Charlie: I agree. But we also need to make sure the UI is polished. The "Vibe Coding" aesthetic is crucial for adoption.
Alice: Good point. Bob, can you take lead on the Skills Engine backend? We need it to run isolated processes.
Bob: Yes, I'll handle that. I'll use child_process.fork for isolation.
Charlie: I'll work on the Frontend using Vue 3 and Tailwind. I'll make sure the dark mode looks premium.
Alice: Great. Also, we need to support multiple LLM providers, not just Claude. DeepSeek is getting popular.
Bob: That will require an Adapter pattern in the LLMService. I can add that to my list.
Alice: Okay. Let's aim to have a prototype by next Friday.
Charlie: Sounds good. I'll need the API contract from Bob by Wednesday.
Bob: Will do.
